# Building the Space Biology “Model Zoo”
 Hello! This is the ZTD team! This is our solution for the Nasa hackathon challenge that called “Building the Space Biology “Model Zoo”
 This GitHub repository contains all our code. BUT❗❗❗ There are no AI files, since the weight of 1 file is at least more than 5 GB!
 How you can test our project?
